        <p>You might be confused if you live anywhere else in the world since in <em>American</em> football, you use your hands to handle the ball. If you used your feet, well... that'd be too obvious!</p>

        <p>This sport's name is a little more intuitive thn the last. It's called basketball because in the original game, the goals were peach baskets! Oh, you also weren't allowed to dribble when it was first invented. ðŸ¤¯</p>

        <p>My personal favorite sport to watch in the olymipcs, gymnastics is a fun mix of art, acrobatics, and some aspects of dance. Gymnastics was "invented" as a way to train soldiers in Ancient Greece!</p>

        <p>Swimming is a great form of exercise. Swimmers burn off a good bit more calories than bikers or runners, and swimming is a complete full-body workout. It has been an olympic sport since 1896.</p>

      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Hockey is basically soccer on ice. Instead of a ball though, you use a puck and hit it with a stick. One big difference it is known for though is that players are allowed to fight on the ice, with a penelty after it ends.</p>
