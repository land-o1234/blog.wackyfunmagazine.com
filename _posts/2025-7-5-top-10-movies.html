      <p class="item-votes">Votes: 7</p>
      <div class="item-description">
        <p>The Lord of the Rings movies trilogy is certainly a cinematic masterpiece! Did you know, however, that it <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73331/20-epic-facts-about-lord-rings-trilogy">wasn't originally</a> supposed to be 3 movies? Its initial script was for two movies, and the movie's producers even suggested condensing it into one movie to help the ever-growing budget. I wonder if they only made one movie if it would have been about eight hours long. ðŸ˜†</p>

        <p>In Harry Potter, they ride the Hogwarts Express to get to school. They enter through a portal in between platforms 9 and 10 at Kings Cross Station. The portal of course isn't real, but you can <a href="https://thirdeyetraveller.com/platform-9-3-4-london/">get a photo-op</a> with the sign and a luggage cart embedded into a brick wall at the Kings Cross Harry Potter Shop!</p>

      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Do you remember the scene where a captured Westley meets Count Rugen? He gets a shock when he sees that the Count is the "six-fingered man"! During their conversation though, the count knocks Westley out with the butt of his sword. The funny part is, Westley's actor, Cary Elwes, <a href = "https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62073/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-princess-bride#inline-text-41">actually was</a> <em>knocked unconscious</em> accidentally and had to be taken to the ER!</p>

      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Most of Forrest Gump is set in Alabama. As is typical in many movies though, the filming locations <a href = "https://www.al.com/life/2019/06/35-fascinating-facts-about-forrest-gump.html">are different</a> than the setting in the movie. Most of the filming was done in Georgia and South Carolina. In fact, the Mekong Delta of Vietnam was recreated in a South Carolina swamp in Hunting Island State Park!</p>

      <div class="item-description">
        <p>In Pride and Prejudice, the actor Rosamond Pike played the role of Jane Bennet. Funnily enough, she <a href="https://screenrant.com/pride-and-prejudice-2005-behind-the-scenes/">had already said</a> she'd play Rita Seeker in the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter movie! She decided to act in Pride and Prejudice instead though because she would have to act in the next Harry Potter movie as well and she didn't want to have the long-term commitment.</p>

      <p class="item-votes">Votes: 4</p>
      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Star Wars is probably one of the most well-known movie franchises of all time. They've had many actors over the years. Do you know who the actor Anthony Daniels played? He was a beloved golden droid named C-3PO. You've probably heard of his buddy R2-D2 as well. While R2 was a mix of a costumed actor and a remote-controlled robot, Anthony Daniels <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/star-wars-facts/#:~:text=The%20droid%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20really%20a%20robot">wore</a> a very heavy and uncomfortable costume throughout the entire filming of the movies.</p>

      <p class="item-votes">Votes: 3</p>
      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Inception is a thriller movie by Christopher Nolan that deals with concepts of shared dreams and subconsciousness. There are a few large explosions in the movie, and Christopher wanted to see the true reactions from the actors. While they couldn't truly blow stuff up, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61038/22-things-you-might-not-know-about-inception#:~:text=11.%20Christopher%20Nolan%20wanted%20the%20explosions">they used nitrogen</a> under pressure to set off around the actors. That way it's more realistic than if they're just being directed to jump from an explosion.</p>

      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Another Christopher Nolan film, Interstellar is a science fiction movie about space exploration and the survival of the human race. The cool thing is, all the science from the movie is <a href="https://screenrant.com/behind-the-scenes-facts-interstellar/#:~:text=Dr.%20Kip%20Thorne%2C%20the%20theoretical%20physicist%20and%20Nobel%20laureate">completely real</a> and fact-checked by the theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Dr. Kip Thorne. He and Christopher Nolan agreed that all the true laws of physics had to be followed and any speculatory rules had to come from him.</p>

      <div class="item-description">
        <p>Top Gun: Maverick is the long-awaited sequel to the original Top Gun film that came out in <em>1986</em>. That makes the gap between them <em>36 years</em>! Lead actor Tom Cruise is known for making his films intensely realistic, and this is no exception. He hosted a "boot camp" for the actors to prepare for their roles, which included real flight training and G-force simulations. All actors but Tom Cruise and Monica Barbaro threw up during this training according to producer Jerry Bruckheimer ðŸ˜‚.</p>

        <div class="item-description">
          <p>Paul Blart: Mall Cop and its sequel are probably my top 2 movies of all time. The first movie follows a hilarious mall cop (played by Kevin James) and his daughter as he has a major problem at the mall. This is definitely a must-watch for anyone who enjoys hilarious movies!</p>

          <p>I'm surprised that this movie didn't get more votes! It's a classic holiday film that never fails to make me laugh. Will Ferrell has made buddy the elf a staple during the holiday season at our house.</p>
