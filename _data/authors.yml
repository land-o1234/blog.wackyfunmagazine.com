  bio: "Hi, I’m Jonah and I write articles for Wacky Fun magazine. I always thought writing was boring when I was a little kid, but recently found a passion for it in writing these articles. I don’t have any published works and am not currently writing any other than articles. If you like them, please let me know and I might consider writing a book or story. Thanks!"

Joshua Brown:
  name: "Joshua Brown"
  bio: "Hello. I am Joshua Brown. I have been telling stories since I was little, and used to sit with my grandmother and have her write down my tales as I came up with them. In 2021 I began a story on Notes, but it was horrible, and I lost interest. Now, I’ve written twelve drafts of books, published a full length novel, and am now rewriting the first book in my series. I write articles for Wacky Fun Magazine, and have since the beginning summer of 2024. I mean, I write a lot of articles. If you like my writing, you can contact me to preview whatever I’m working on. Thanks!"
